Line 1: Get a list with the names of all the guests that are currently powered off.

Line 2: Get the events from the last 7 days that were created for a “power off” task.

Line 3: Extract the names of all the guests for which we found a “power off” event.

Line 4: Remove from our list of currently powered off guests all those for which we found a “power off” event in the last week.

Ok, this works. On the console we see all the guests that have been powered off for more than a week.

But still, this script took in a modest vSphere environment 32 minutes to complete.

Isn’t there a faster way ?

There is indeed an important improvement we can make to the script. The Get-VIEvent cmdlet has an -Entity parameter where you tell the cmdlet to only collect events that were fired for one or more specific entities.

If we add the -Entity parameter, the script becomes something like this.

#>
$events = Get-VIEvent -Finish (Get-Date).AddDays(-90) -Entity $vms | where{$_.FullFormattedMessage -like "*is powered off"}

This line is showing the events that are 90 days old that has a "powered off" message.  What is excluding the systems from being powered on/off again after this in your report?

Or am I reading this wrong and it is including events that are between 90 and 0 days old?
