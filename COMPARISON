I am assuming a standard CSV file, and what you posted above was copied out of Excel and not the text of the CSV.  So I am working from input that looks like ...

Server,IP,State
Box1,192.168.25.1,Enabled
Box2,192.168.25.2,Disabled
Box3,192.168.25.3,Disabled

So this seems to work with a standard set of CSV files.

# powershell.com/.../19384.aspx
$reference = Import-Csv -Path C:\ephemeral\old.csv
$lookup = $reference | Group-Object -AsHashTable -AsString -Property Server

$results = Import-Csv -Path C:\ephemeral\new.csv | foreach {
    $server = $_.Server
    Write-Verbose "Looking for $server"
    if ($lookup.ContainsKey($server))
    {
        $oldState = ($lookup[$server]).State
    }
    else
    {
        $oldState = "Unknown"
    }
    if ($_.State -ne $oldState)
    {
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            Server = $server
            IP = $_.IP
            OldState = $oldState
            NewState = $_.State
        }
    }
}
