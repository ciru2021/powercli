Introduction I hope the coffee has kicked in…
Background 
 We’re back for the 3rd time in a row 
• You just cant get enough of PowerCLI! 

 No 1 unique solution for a task/problem. 
 Some are better 
• More performant 
• More flexible 

 This session shows a number of these, so you don’t have to find them out yourselves
Common PowerCLI Questions The PowerCLI Community is huge! This session will make your life easier (and also full of famous people)
Common PowerCLI Questions The PowerCLI Community is huge! This session will make you an expert
Community Question I sense a new force in the galaxy, what is this PowerCLI ?

PowerCLI Overview 
 Why PowerCLI? 
• PowerShell is universal, easy to use and works with objects  Why universal? 
• The standard on Windows platforms 
• Reuse your PowerShell knowledge in different applications 

 Easy to use? 
• The verb-noun construct in plain English 
• Help is available 
• Start with minimal set of cmdlets, and grow

 What’s with these objects? 
• Think of it as unit that has data and functions 
• Objects flow through the pipeline to the next cmdlet

PowerCLI Overview – Simple Examples 
 Simple to read/write New-VM –Name VM1 –VMHost MyEsx 
 Easy to extend for big(ger) environments 1..10 | Foreach {New-VM –Name VM$_ –VMHost MyEsx} 
 Clear, understandable minimal code Get-Datastore | Select Name,Type,FileSystemVersion 
 Access to API covers what is not (yet) there Get-VMHost | Select Name, @{N=“Reboot”;E={$_.ExtensionData.Summary.RebootRequired}}
Community Question I already know most things… So what's new in PowerCLI 5.5 R1?

PowerCLI Snap-in’s 
 Core • Managing vSphere 
 Image Builder • Working with Image Profiles 
 Auto Deploy • Deploying ESXi via PXE 
 License • Working with vSphere Licensing 
 VDS • Working with vSphere Distributed Switch 
 Cloud • vCloud Director Providers 
 Tenant • vCloud Director Tenants Core Image Builder Auto Deploy License Cloud Tenant VDS

PowerCLI 5.5 R1 - Overview New Cmdlets to manage vSphere Tags  Manage Tags in the vSphere environment  Assign Tags to vSphere Objects  Remove Tag assignments from vSphere Objects VDS  Easy VDS Migration  Manage Private VLANs  Manage VDS Policies  Manage VDS Ports VM Console  Open a console for vSphere/vCloud VM  Open multiple consoles at once  Output the URL to open VM Consoles vCloud Director 5.5 Support  Support for vCD 5.5 Host Licensing  Assign Host Licensing

Community Question Quit your jibber jabber, how can I apply some PowerShell best practices to PowerCLI, fool!

Best Practices 
 Store results in variables 
• Speed 
• Re-use 
• Filter on the variables  Use Get-Help and the Examples –ShowWindow 

 Break things down into functions – Don’t forget splatting 
 Try/Catch/Throw 
 Filter on the left 
• Get-Event | Sort Date | Where { $_.Something –eq “5” } 
• Get-Event | Where { $_.Something –eq “5” } | Sort Date  Steal from the best (Lucd.info) and write the rest  Do not use Write-Host as output, only for output to console • Use Write-Verbose or Write-Warning

Community Question How do I run these scripts?
What Is the Best Way to Run My Script? 
 PS1 file / dot source / functions - what does this mean? 
 Console (PowerCLI Prompt) / Editor 
 Scheduled Task in Windows (add-pssnapin VMware.vimautomation*) 
 vCenter Alert action 
• VM Creation – Secure a VM 
• Host added to vCenter 

 Robust PS Sessions (See demo later) 
 WebCommander (Future VMware Fling)

Launching the Code DEMO

Community Question Why is PowerCLI so slow?
Why is PowerCLI slow to launch? 
• Load environment 
• PowerShell v1, v2, v3 – Caching 

How can I make it even faster? 
• Remote session 
• Run the Connect-VIServer 
• Run a cmdlet 
• Disconnect/Reconnect from the session (see demo later) 

Why is PowerCLI slower than a direct API call or other SDK? 
• Abstracted Object 
• Easier to read code 
• Easier to work with / Pipeline Results 
• Formulated objects

Why is PowerCLI so Slow? 
 Making results faster 
 Finding the properties you need 
• ExtensionData 
• New-VIProperty 
• Use the Property parameter with Get-View 

 Creating a new object 
• What to read in the SDK • How to create it 
• Creating the bare frame and filling in what's needed 

 Onyx 
• How it is helpful 
• How it is not helpful

Community Question How do I export my information?
Advanced Reporting -CSV/TXT/XML 
• Use whatever is relevant and saves time 
• Think about how you can use the information later 

Export-XLS / Word 
• Export-XLS is a function available on LucD.Info which exports straight to Excel 
• Including multiple sheets and Graphs  vCheck 
• Community driven script to give you the information you need 
• Plugins to add your own checks or remove others for speed 
• Change the Style easily 
• FREE 
• Get Involved!

Performance: Advanced, and Fun, Reporting  The performance data is there, use it!  How to find the available counters?  VMware Tools gives access to guest OS metrics  Data where you don’t expect it, like for example through CIM  And a picture still says more than 1K words • Replace your CSV files with nice graphs • Several options available (XLS, MS Chart…) • Combining metrics in a graph will bring a point across  Mapping of vDisks to OS Partitions (The holy grail)
Advanced Reporting DEMO

Community Question How do the newer versions of PowerShell make a difference?
Use the PowerShell v3 Features  Use the new CIM cmdlets • A wealth of information • Find out what is there (CIM classes)  Robust sessions • See the SIW demo later on  Calling SOAP/REST methods became a lot easier  Ordered objects

CIM Demo DEMO
CIM/SMASH 
 See VMware CIM SMASH/Server Management API for ESXi Documentation 
 Result in PNG/PDF/…

Server In Waiting 
 PowerCLI is great ! 
 …but do some of these sound familiar ? 
• Slow Connect-VIServer 
• Slow first cmdlet 
• Aligning PowerCLI snapin versions 
• Exceptions in big environments 

 We did, and we were fed up with those 
 PS Remoting I 
 Use PS Remoting with robust sessions ! 
 A “work horse” box 
 Lots of CPU power & memory (if needed) 
 Start a remote session 
• Load PowerCLI 
• Connect-VIServer 
• Execute any PowerCLI cmdlet (JIT) 
• Disconnect the remote PSSession
PS Remoting II 
 Discover with Get-PSSession 
 Use Connect-PSSession ! 
• Connects to robust session 
• PowerCLI environment is ready 
  Some drawbacks 
• Reconnect 
 same account 
• Sessions tend to get bloated (leaks) 
• Some GUIs have a problem (PSP, PowerGUI)

PS Remoting III - Schematic SIW Session 3 Session 2 Session 1 Server 2012 Core 1 New-PSSession Disconnect-PSSession Invoke-Command # PowerCLI environment 2 Get-PSSession Connect-PSSession Enter-PSSession Invoke-Command
PS Remoting IV - Gotchas 
 Set up PowerCLI in the PSSession 
 Pre W2K12 – mind the available memory
SIW Demo DEMO
Comparison – Classic vs SIW Classic SIW Connect-VIServer 14.6 0 Get- Datacenter(1st) 5.3 0.1 Get-Datacenter 0.1 0.1
Community Question I'm all about Events, but how can I use them?
Events - What 
 Used to record significant state changes of managed entities 
 Stored in the vCenter DB  Retention!

Events – Objects - Inheritance Event VmEvent VmDeployed Event Template srcTemplateCreatedTime … vm EventEx ExtendedEvent Arguments eventTypeId … General Event message data eventTypeId …
Events – Simple Retrieval 
 Get-VIEvent 
 Attention points 
• MaxSamples: default is 100 
• Entity: is not recursive $esx = Get-VMHost -Name ESX1 $start = (Get-Date).AddDays((-1) Get-VIEvent -MaxSamples ([int]::MaxValue) -Entity $esx -Start $start
Events – Filtering I 
 Get-VIEvent has limited filters 
 Use a Where-clause on all returned objects 
• Filtering done on your machine ! $esx = Get-VMHost -Name ESX1 $start = (Get-Date).AddDays((-1) Get-VIEvent -MaxSamples ([int]::MaxValue) -Entity $esx -Start $start | Where {$_ -is [VMware.Vim.VmDeployed]}
Events Demo I DEMO
Events – Filtering II 
 Use EventHistoryCollector 
• Filtering on vSphere Server 
• More filtering options $esx = Get-VMHost -Name ESX1 $start = (Get-Date).AddDays((-1) Get-VIEventPlus -Entity $esx -Start $start -EventType “VmDeployed” Up to 80 times faster !
Events Demo II DEMO

Events – Which One ? 
 The ‘regular’ events are in the SDK Reference 
 Other, go via EventManager 
 Or, use the Event-O-Matic !
Events Demo III DEMO

Community Question This stuff is MAGIC How do I take it further?

Integration Next Steps 
 PowerShell has many Snapins/Modules and doesn’t care what the technology is 
• Microsoft 
• CIM Cmdlets / Active Directory Cmdlets / Windows Cmdlets • 3rd Party 
• NetApp / PernixData  Rest API 
• Invoke-RestMethod 
• Invoke-Webrequest  Read from files 
• XML 
• CSV 
• TXT

Further Automation of your Day to Day Tasks 
 Do you do the same thing every day? 
• Snapshot a VM to make sure its ok 
 Do you love documentation? 
• PowerGUI Export / PowerGUI Reports / Export to Word / Export-XLS 
• CIM Demo 

 Module for vShield 
• REST API 

 Other VMware products with Automation (Automation Triangle)
